# Document Features

Every time that Cursor Agent implements a feature (after confirming with the
user that the feature is complete and without bugs), create a markdown file in
the `/docs/` directory explaining how to use the feature (in Simple English).

Also update the `README.md` file to reflect the new feature.

Bump the package version in all the relevant files (e.g., `package.json`,
`bun.lock`, etc.). alwaysApply: true
