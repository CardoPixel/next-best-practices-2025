# Markdown Quality Standards

All markdown documents must comply with all markdown good practices.

Confirm markdown quality with the extension davidanson.vscode-markdownlint which
is recommended for this project and lints markdown files.

Ensure all markdown documents don't have lint warnings or errors.

Follow proper markdown formatting, heading hierarchy, link formatting, and code
block syntax. description: globs: alwaysApply: false
